            <i>A collection of scales based on the harmonic series, with a touch of xen.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            This pattern has become a compilation. It began with just the two related bizarro takes on the
            harmonic series I developed together back in 2016: the matharmonic series and the edharmonic series. But
            when it came time to implement some of the other musical scales I've described that are also based on the
            harmonic series, I balked at the idea of introducing a separate pattern as their home, and/or I was tempted
            by the challenge to achieve them using the same underlying mechanisms through which I was bringing the
            matharmonic and edharmonic to life. Well, I shouldn't write the act off as a mere indulgence; indeed I have
            many good reasons for my goal to standardize my recent musical work under a single system.
        </p>
        <p>
            So in the end, this pattern contains the power to take the form of my <a href="#matharmonic-edharmonic">matharmonic
            and edharmonic series</a>, as well as the <a href="#third-tritave">third tritave of the odd harmonics</a>,
            and my set of <a href="#particular">"particular" series</a>, plus some others. To make this happen,
            Xenharmonic series has by far the most complicated specs of any of my patterns, with a whopping thirteen
            interactive controls. Please check out the presets — those are my original patterns — but take a look at
            which of the controls they care about, and explore fiddling with them and creating new Frankenstein scales
            from all the harmonic series related ideas at play here.

            So if the traditional harmonic series is defined as beginning with a base frequency a and stepping up the
            integer multiples of that frequency, then we can write the sequence of frequencies <b>{S<sub>n</sub>}</b>
            where <b>n ≥
            1</b> and <b>S<sub>n</sub></b> =

            which admittedly looks a bit over the top expressed as a partial sum, but it helps for comparison with the

            <b>S<sub>n</sub></b> (though for aesthetic reasons which we'll get to later the actual final version of this

            §2. A Tale of Two Series
        </h4>
        <p>
            This all began with a simple enough question: what is the relationship between the musical harmonic series
            and the mathematical harmonic series?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="right"></div>

        <p>
            Without having pried the issue apart before, I'd been cruising through life comfortable with the assumption
            that the former was an application of the latter to the musical domain: the terms of the mathematical
            harmonic series being <b>1, ½, ⅓, ¼, ...</b> and the musical harmonic series the succession of pitches you
            hear plucking strings of those lengths<sup>1</sup>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="right">
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup> Plus I also knew that they both had something to do with logarithms (more on this later).
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="middle">
        <p>
            But there's more to the mathematical harmonic series than that: it is not merely the <i>sequence</i> of its
            terms
            <b>1, ½, ⅓, ¼, ...</b> but the <i>summation</i> of those terms: <b>1 + ½ + ⅓ + ¼ + ...</b> In the previous ¶
            I was
            simulating the ignorance of my youth by glossing over this fact.
        </p>
        <p>
            In math, you see, a distinction is made between a <i>series</i> and a <i>sequence</i>. A <i>sequence</i> is
            an ordered collection
            of objects (terms); optionally it can include repeated terms and/or be infinite in length. A <i>series</i>,
            on the
            other hand, is the sum total of the terms of such a sequence (in particular if it is one of the infinite
            kind).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="right"></div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="middle">
        <p>
            So the mathematical harmonic series qualifies as a series in math-speak (as we would hope it would).
            But the musical harmonic series? Not so much. It is no singular object, the expression of the sum of some
            infinite mathematical sequence. It is, rather, one such sequence of objects. Being the succession of
            multiples of a base sound wave frequency which increase by 1 each time — <b>1x, 2x, 3x, 4x,
            ...</b><sup>2</sup> —
            we can see that it has a definite order, and it will go on infinitely, and while it does not happen to
            contain any copies of any of its terms that's perfectly fine.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="right">
        <p>
            <sup>2</sup> This being the effect of strings getting subdivided into lengths of <b>1, ½, ⅓, ¼, ...</b>; if
            you took the terms of the mathematical harmonic series directly as your multiples what you'd end up with is
            what we call the subharmonic series.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="middle">
        <p>
            To be clear: I'm not at all proposing an effort to rally the musical community around a renaming of one of
            the fundamental building blocks of music. Outside of mathematical settings, we can get away with "series" as
            the descriptor of the musical harmonic series. Since the general sense of series refers to a number of
            similar things coming one after another. Which, of course, the musical harmonic series is.

            And I couldn't really get away with conforming the musical harmonic series to math-speak even if I wanted
            to, because not only was I wrong about the musical harmonic series being an application of a math idea to
            music, it turns out I was extra wrong i.e. that it's the other way around<sup>3</sup>. When the Divine
            Brotherhood of
            Pythagoras came up with the original (musical) harmonic series, infinity was not yet well understood, and
            mathematical series hadn't been invented/discovered. Over a millennia later when mathematicians finally
            conceived of their series — the sum of the infinite sequence of the reciprocals of the natural numbers: <b>1
            +
            ½ + ⅓ + ¼ + ... + 1/k</b> as <b>k</b> approaches infinity, or in Big Sigma notation:

            <sup>3</sup> That is to say that if anything we should gripe about the mathematical harmonic series failing
            to conform to the music-speak, except that a) there is no technical meaning of series in music to worry
            about, and b) I have no idea as to the historical and etymological (dis)continuity between our modern
            English collision on meanings of "series" and these mathematicians' naming in the first place.

            — they could have named it anything, but I suppose why not name it "harmonic" after something related to it

            to write math history here. I'm intimidated by David Foster Wallace's <i>Everything and More: A Compact
            History of Infinity</i> and criticisms theroef (though I have definitely cribbed its style here).

            §3. Sonic boomerang

        <p>
            Now that I had nailed down the relationship between the mathematical and musical harmonic series, and
            learned that I had been wrong about the musical harmonic series being the mathematical harmonic series
            applied to music, I began to wonder: in what way(s) <i>could</i> I apply the mathematical harmonic series to
            music?
            Bring this puppy back around!
        </p>
        <p>
            So there's another term in math called a <i>partial sum</i>. It's related to the math concept of a series.
            If the
            series is defined as the sum of "all" of the terms of an infinite sequence, then a partial sum is defined as
            the sum of some finite number of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            So the first partial sum of the harmonic series, written <b>S<sub>1</sub></b>, is trivially <b>1</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>S<sub>2</sub></b> is <b>3/2</b>, because
            <br>
            <b>1/1 + 1/2 =</b>
            <br>
            <b>2/2 + 1/2 =</b>
            <br>
            <b>3/2</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            And <b>S<sub>3</sub></b> is <b>11/6</b>, because
            <br>
            <b>1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 =</b>
            <br>
            <b>6/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 =</b>
            <br>
            <b>11/6</b>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="right"></div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="middle">
        <p>
            And so on. So the sequence of partial sums<sup>1</sup> of the mathematical harmonic series is
            <b>
                <br>
                1/1,

                <br>
                11/6,
                <br>
                25/12,
                <br>
                137/60,
                <br>
                49/20,
                <br>
                363/140,
                <br>
                ...
            </b>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="right">
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup> As far as I've found, we have no special term for a sequence of partial sums.

            So if you thought before that there was no practical difference between the math concept of series which
            involves summation (since who cares what the sum total of all these terms are, isn't it just <b>∞</b>?) and
            the general usage of series, that I was merely splitting hairs over whether we connected terms with commas
            or plus signs, now you see where my interest lay. Already things are looking mighty interesting, at least if
            you're into microtonal/xenharmonic/alt-tuning stuff like I am.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember that the musical harmonic series is a sequence of pitches starting at some base frequency and
            moving up increasing multiples of it, <b>1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, ...</b> Well, we can deploy this new sequence in
            much the same way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose we start with a base frequency of <b>220 Hz</b>. The harmonic series on <b>220 Hz</b> would go <b>220
            Hz</b>,
            440 Hz, 660 Hz, 880 Hz, ...</b> But this experimental series of ours goes differently: <b>220 Hz, 330 Hz,
            403.3 Hz, 458.3 Hz,
            ...</b>

            Except that's there's a little fudging I'd like to do, and this isn't pretty, so I'll get it out of the way
            right now, and you can probably ignore this bit if you're in a hurry. You'll notice that the first steps of
            the harmonic series proportionally are <b>2x</b> and <b>3/2x</b>. We have a <b>3/2x</b> move our new series,
            too, but it's its first step. I'd like those to align. Plus, you'll notice that we never actually get to use
            the <b>1</b>which is the first term of our new series as an interval. So I think it's fair to say for our
            new series that we'll start at <b>0</b>, then <b>+ 1</b>, then <b>+ ½</b>, etc. Except that we can't use <b>0</b>
            as a multiplier on frequency<sup>2</sup>, so we instead have to make our expression for our frequencies a
            little more complicated: it'll be <b>a</b> at <b>n = 1</b>, and for all further <b>a</b>:

            to the

            What is this beast? I like it. It sounds interesting. I want to know more. Since it's an application of the
            mathematical harmonic series in a manner evocative of the musical harmonic series, maybe I'll call it the
            "matharmonic series"<sup>3</sup>.

            <sup>3</sup> I also considered "metaharmonic" and "epiharmonic" for their self-referentiality/uponicity, as
            this series involves taking one sense of the harmonic series and applying it to another, but something just
            didn't quite feel self-referential/uponicious enough.

            One of the first things I note is that after not too long the matharmonic series starts to rise in pitch
            much more slowly than the harmonic series, and it even begins to sound like it might stop rising altogether
            at some point.

            It'd be too easy to conclude this was completely explained by how its rate of rise decreases over time. Too
            easy as in wrong. Since as you probably noticed, the harmonic series <i>also</i> seems to be slowing down,
            even
            though we know its rate of rise remains constant.

            Depending on how familiar you are with the harmonic series, you may or may not be surprised by this
            phenomenon. Its explanation lies in human pitch perception, which in math-speak we'd say is
            <i>logarithmic.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll define logarithms later, but for now it should suffice to say that we hear relationships between
            pitches through ratios not differences. So while the <i>difference</i> between each pair of adjacent terms
            in the
            musical harmonic series remains constant, sure, look at their <i>ratios</i> as you go farther up: <b>2:1,
            3:2, 4:3,
            5:4, 6:5, ...</b><sup>1</sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="right">
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup> These are called "superparticular ratios". Which I mention mostly just 'cuz it's such
            a cool name.

            If this doesn't quite seal the deal for you, putting it in decimal form may: <b>2, 1.5, 1.<span
                style="text-decoration:overline;">3</span>, 1.25, 1.2,
            ...</b>
            The ratios are getting smaller. Meaning that while we're actually continuing to move by the same absolute
            amounts of <i>frequency</i>, we're perceiving less of a relative change in <i>pitch</i> each time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Frequency tells what a sound wave actually is; pitch tells how we hear it.

            A traditional graph is fine for frequency, but a better way to visualize pitch is to use a graph with a
            logarithmic scale (again, deferring definition). If we space things vertically by ratios (but importantly
            keep spacing things horizontally by difference, which traditional spacing we call <i>linear</i>), we can now
            see
            what we've been hearing<sup>2</sup>:

            And here we can also see that the matharmonic series is doubly curved-off. So we could say that the rising
            of the traditional harmonic series is fighting only against the diminishing returns of perceptual
            significance in upwards frequency motion, while the matharmonic series contends with <i>both</i> that <i>as
            well as</i> an
            actual decreasing in its rate of upward frequency motion.

            On the pitch chart, the harmonic series looks curved. And I noticed that on the frequency chart — where the
            harmonic series looks straight — the matharmonic series looks curved in a similar way. So now I began to
            wonder: just what was the relationship between these two curves?

            I already knew about logarithmic pitch perception. And I also already knew that the mathematical harmonic
            series had something to do with logarithms<sup>1</sup>. But if you recall, before I started picking all this
            apart I
            thought that the musical and mathematical harmonic series were essentially the same thing, so in my head
            this was all just fuzzily conflated; whatever logarithmic aspects each one exuded I assumed were nothing but
            different manifestations of a shared fundamental element.

            What I found was that the partial sums of the mathematical harmonic series roughly approximates the <i>natural
            logarithm.</i> That is, the logarithm that gets its own cool notation <b>ln</b>, the base <b>e</b>
            logarithm,
            where <b>e</b> is one
            of those transcendental mathematical constants, in fact one of the most famousest ones ever, <b>≈
            2.71828</b>. So
            the curve that the matharmonic series was exhibiting in frequency space was then indeed a logarithmic curve:
            the natural kind.
        </p>
        <p>
            And what of the harmonic series, in pitch space? Well that one I knew was a base <b>2</b> logarithm, as I
            had
            chosen the ratio <b>2:1</b> to space things vertically, because that is the most specialest ratio in pitch
            perception, the one of <i>pitch class equivalence</i>: it is the one which — for whatever human
            psychoacoustic
            reasons — gives us what we hear as a higher or lower version of the same note, and thus we even go so far as
            to name them as different numbers of the same letter e.g. <b>A3</b>, <b>A4</b>, <b>A5</b>.

            It took some time for it to sink for me in that there was nothing and had never been anything inherently
            linking the musical harmonic series to base <b>2</b>. This was so difficult to accept what with the ubiquity
            of
            music-speak of "octaves<sup>2</sup> of the harmonic series". The harmonic series is linked to the
            logarithmicity of our
            pitch perception, yes, because it is a primal demonstration of it. But I could have picked any logarithmic
            scale I wanted to illustrate the logarithmicity of pitch perception: <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>5/4</b>,
            <b>e</b>, whatever. The fact that
            every <b>2n</b> entry in the harmonic series happens to sound "samey" — and that there's no other special
            ratio
            quite like that — was why I picked <b>2</b> as my base, but it has nothing inherently to do with this
            general
            logarithmicity of pitch perception.

            And it's here that we arrive at the kind of wild (to me anyhow) realization that the logarithmic aspects of
            the musical harmonic series and the mathematical harmonic series are completely unrelated. The spectrum of
            color imbued by the base <b>2</b> logarithmic lens through which we perceive pitch class equivalence has
            nothing to
            do with the fact that partial sums of sequences of reciprocals of its terms approximate a base <b>e</b>

            So the matharmonic scale in pitch space's doubly-curved-off-ness was accounted for by layering two <i>different</i>
            logarithms: it was already an ln in linear space, then it got plot on a <b>log<sub>2</sub></b> scale.

            §6. The harmony of nature

        <p>
            Naturally my next topic of wonderment became: if the base <b>2</b> logarithmicity of pitch class equivalence
            is a
            given, what if I deployed the mathematical harmonic series in all its base <b>e</b> logarithmic glory
            directly into
            that space?
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, what if I attempted to draw my matharmonic series — instead of my frequency chart — on my
            pitch chart, using its <b>2x</b> intervals as my units?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well alright, but how does it work to use the <b>2x</b> interval as the unit of the mathematical harmonic
            series
            (which is again <b>1 + ½ + ⅓ + ¼ + ...</b>)? I'll tell you that it's not multiplying repeatedly by these
            fractions
            of <b>2</b>. That'd be too easy (again, as in wrong). In order to "pretend" our logarithmic scale is a
            linear
            scale, we have to express whatever we're "adding" or "subtracting" in terms of a power of <b>2</b> which we
            would
            then multiply by.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may think that notion sounds ridiculous, but believe it or not this is most likely how most of your
            interactions with musical pitch have gone in your life. If you've been participating in the standard Western
            tuning system (e.g. classical, jazz, pop, rock, most music), then whenever you treated pitch linearly, say,
            by counting up twelve equal steps from <b>A4</b> to <b>A5</b>, adding one step at a time (<b>A4</b>,
            <b>B♭4</b>,
            <b>B4</b>, <b>C5</b>, <b>D♭5</b>, <b>D5</b>, <b>E♭5</b>, <b>E5</b>,
            <b> F5</b>, <b>F♯5</b>, <b>G5</b>, <b>G♯5</b>, <b>A5</b>), what you were actually doing under the hood was
            multiplying the frequency of your
            pitch by the twelfth root of <b>2</b>, and you did it twelve times in a row.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <i>root</i> just being a power less than <b>1</b>, and the <i>nth root of 2</i> just being another way of
            saying "multiply n of me
            together to get 2". Just like how the square root of <b>2</b> aka <b>√2</b> aka <b>2<sup>½</sup></b> is the
            number you multiply by
            itself to get <b>2</b>, i.e. you multiply two of it together to get <b>2</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try it yourself! The twelfth root of <b>2 ≈ 1.059463</b>. Multiply twelve of those together and you get
            <b>2</b>. The frequency of <b>A4</b> is <b>440 Hz</b>, <b>Bb4</b> is <b>466.16</b>, and <b>B4</b> is <b>493.88</b>.
            Both <b>466.16 / 440</b> and <b>493.88 / 466.16 ≈ 1.059463</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            And <b>493.88 / 440</b> is the sixth root of <b>2</b> aka <b>2<sup>⅙</sup></b>, which you may recall that
            you can sum powers when multiplying
            like bases e.g. <b>x2 ⋅ x3 = x5</b> (and of course <b>1/12 + 1/12 = 1/6</b>). What this demonstrates clearly
            is how
            expressing pitches in terms of powers of <b>2</b> has given us the power to gear down one mathematical order
            of
            complexity from multiplication to addition. Multiplying twelve 12th roots of <b>2</b> would involve us
            summing
            their powers up to <b>12 / 12</b>, and of course <b>2^(12/12) = 2^1 = 2</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enough explanation. Back to the task at hand. We're going to take the terms of the mathematical harmonic
            series and create a new sequence which is those as powers/roots of <b>2</b>. Then we'll create a new series
            out of
            that sequence. Except that since our terms aren't terms but factors (i.e. we're gonna multiply them, not add
            them), we'll use the Big Pi notation:

            Then we'll consider the partial products of this, using those as multipliers on some base frequency. In

            times the

            <sup>1</sup> As we might have expected, we get a slightly more curved-off line than the traditional harmonic
            series. It
            helps me anyway to think of it this way, in terms of the definition of a logarithm (which we have thus far
            gotten away with ignoring): the number you'd have to raise your logarithmic base to get a given number. So
            when you look at a base <b>2</b> logarithmic graph, you're not surprised that you reach <b>y = 1</b> once
            <b>x = 2</b>, <b>y = 2</b>
            once <b>x = 4</b>, and <b>y = 3</b> once <b>x = 8</b>, because <b>21 = 2</b>, <b>22 = 4</b>, and <b>23 =
            8</b>, respectively. Accordingly, when you
            look at a base <b>e</b> logarithmic graph, you're not surprised that you reach <b>y = 1</b> once <b>x =
            e</b>, and <b>y = 2</b> once <b>x =
            e</b><sup>2</sup>. So since in the base <b>e</b> logarithmic graph you don't reach <b>y = 2</b> until <b>x =
            e2 ≈ 7.389056</b>, but you reach it
            by <b>x = 4</b> in the base <b>2</b> logarithmic graph, it's clear that the base e version rises more
            slowly. In fact, the
            larger the number you use for your base (<b>10</b> is also common) the increasingly extremely curved off
            your curve
            will be.

            go up by six frets/keys. Then by four. Then by three. It's not until you get to the step of <b>5ed2</b> that
            you first
            encounter a pitch interval unable to be expressed in terms of <b>12ed2</b> steps (i.e <b>1ed2 -> 12 * 1/12,
            2ed2 -> 6
            * 1/12, 3ed2 -> 4 * 1/12, 4ed2 -> 3 * 1/12</b>). You could also think of this as moving by <b>1200</b>
            cents, then <b>600</b>
            cents, then <b>400</b>, then <b>300</b>, and it's only once you get to <b>240</b> that you're not a multiple
            of <b>100</b>.

            As teased in section §1, you can make an edharmonic series out of any positive factor you want. Here's a
            couple that might be of interest:

            No, I don't think there's anything particularly special about drawing a <b>ln</b> on logarithmic scale with
            <b>e</b> as
            units; tantamount to squaring <b>e</b> maybe?
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the matharmonic series and the edharmonic series are probably the most interesting of these new
            harmonic series. Two different ways of marrying <b>2</b> and <b>e</b>. One is drawing <b>e</b> and then
            putting it
            into <b>2</b>, the other is drawing <b>e</b> directly onto <b>2</b>.
        </p>
        <p> I suppose you could also experiment with doing a <b>log<sub>2</sub></b> in frequency and then seeing it get
            <b>log<sub>2</sub></b>'d
            again by
            pitch. But I wouldn't think it'd be so interesting. Basically just shooting for points in the traditional
            harmonic series, but instead of taking 1 step to reach each next one, taking 2<sup>n</sup> steps.
            And here's where I admit that this all made a great story and all, but that my actual experience of
            questioning, learning, and ideating here was so clumsy, out-of-order, and chaotic that I probably couldn't
            even relate it if I thought it would be a good idea to do so. I think I actually began at the ending here,
            by coming up with the edharmonic series out of nowhere, in terms of steps of shrinking <b>ed2</b>'s.
            Although there
            is some truth to questioning the relationship between the music and math versions of the harmonic series, so
            probably my experience was something like working forwards and backwards through this stuff sameltimeously,
            meeting at several points in the middle. You'll just have to deal with this idealized take on what it might
            have been like to come up with this stuff semi-straightforwardly.

            Since the matharmonic and edharmonic series are not anchored by the octave in the same way as the
            traditional harmonic series, and their lower steps are the relatively more interesting ones, perhaps the
            best pieces to compose with them would involve kind of regular resetting to the root and/or switching to
            move subharmonically.
        </p>
        <p> But until then, here are some Scala files for scales which are <i>all</i> octave-repeating (again despite
            the
            matharmonic or edharmonic scales not repeating the octave interval regularly) if you just want to try to
            improv something maybe:

            Third Tritave of Odd Harmonics
        </h3>
        <p>
            Back at <a href="https://untwelve.org/" target="_blank">Untwelve</a> Summer Camp 2016 this idea popped in my
            head: what if we only used odd members
            of the harmonic series?
        </p>
        <p>
            Listening to the odds from the harmonic series is one thing, and sounds nice and interesting enough:
        </p>

        <p>
            I wanted to make a repeating scale out of this, but I was thwarted because an octave-repeating scale
            essentially introduces even harmonics, e.g. the 5th harmonic copy-pasted up an octave sounds like the (5 *
            2)th harmonic.
        </p>
        <p>
            This idea sat on the cutting room floor for a few weeks then before I had an "aha" moment on my xenharmonic
            series, realizing that there was nothing inherently linking the harmonic series to the octave. I could also
            look at tritaves of the harmonic series, and make a tritave-repeating scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a bonus this would solidify the connection between this idea and the one from which the tritave arose:
            the Bohlen-Pierce Scale, which is based on harmonic intervals eschewing 2 as a factor.
            So here's me going up and then back down three tritaves of this tritave-repeating harmonic scale.

            Particular Series
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you look at the ratios between successive members of the harmonic series, they all superparticular
            ratios, that is, of the form <b>(n+1)/n</b>. But what if you made a scale out of these superparticular
            ratios
            themselves?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>2/1, 3/2, 4/3, 5/4, 6/5...</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, the scale is descending in pitch, as the subharmonic series does. In fact, the
            superparticular series can be thought of as a harmonic series multiplied by a subharmonic series. Of course
            if it was that simple the scales would just cancel out and you'd have a endless series of <b>1, 1, 1, 1,
            ...</b> But
            if you offset the harmonic series and the subharmonic series by 1 step, then you can get superparticular
            series.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you offset them in the other direction, you get the subparticular series:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6...</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Where every member is a subparticular ratio, of the form <b>n/(n+1)</b>. Much less is said about
            subparticular
            ratios (compare 68,000 Google hits for subparticular and basically none for subparticular). But I see no
            reason not to make the generalization. You can see that like the standard harmonic series, the subparticular
            series ascends in pitch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next I propose the duperparticular series:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3/1, 4/2, 5/3, 6/4, 7/5, ...</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The name comes from "super duper", the objectively hilarious reduplicative of the adjective "super". What's
            happening
            now is that every entry in the series is of the form <b>(n+2)/n</b>. Of course I do not find anything in the
            literature about duperparticular ratios, because they are a silly thing, but the scale is interesting. Note
            that as a consequence of being off by 2, every other entry in this series is not going to be in lowest terms
            right off the bat, because it will be a ratio of two even numbers to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally I propose the dubparticular series, which is the cross-pollination of the idea behind the
            duperparticular series and subparticular series:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1/3, 2/4, 3/5, 4/6, 5/7, ...</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can continue to create scales in this family, but I'm sure what you'd name them, or if they'd be of much
            interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you'd like to hear a song I've composed using these four scales, along with the standard harmonic and
            subharmonic series, check it out here: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cmloegcmluin/zdaubyaos">https://soundcloud.com/cmloegcmluin/zdaubyaos</a>
            It also uses these ratios extensively in its rhythms.

            I came up with the name "denominated harmonic series" before I noticed that they were already named and
            well-described and explored. More info here: <a href="https://en.xen.wiki/w/Overtone_scales#Over-n_Scales"
